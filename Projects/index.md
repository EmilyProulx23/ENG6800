# Projects

As a dedicated teacher, the majority of my research interests center around pedagogy, especially writing instruction. I have presented research on topics such as learning in online writing courses, using publishing opportunities to improve student agency, teaching cultural and traditional rhetorics in civic engagement courses, instructing information literacy using current events and popular culture, and most recently, using ePortfolios to teach student agency and promote transfer.

Since my research is so closely tied to my work in the classroom, this portion of my teaching portfolio includes samples from presentations I have delivered at conferences such as the Sunshine State Teaching and Learning Conference, UCF's Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning Winter Conference, Rhetoric Society of America, and the South Atlantic Modern Language Association.

### UCF Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning Winter Conference (December 2019)
The theme of this conference was understanding our students, with a focus on UCF's recent designation as a Hispanic Serving Institution. To contribute to this discussion, I presented on adjustments I've made to my own course design to best enhance the experience of multilingual writers in my classes.

### Sunshine State Teaching and Learning Conference (February 2019)
Along with fellow instructor Megan Lambert, I presented "ePortfolio Curriculum Design to Promote Student Agency and Transfer." This presentation discussed ePortfolios as a High-Impact Practice, as well as assessment and curriculum design suggestions for an ePortfolio course.

### UCF Faculty Center for Teaching and Learning Winter Conference (December 2018)
This conference focused on transparency, and I attended several panels on how interdisciplinary faculty are creating transparent assignments and curricula. In my own presentation, I discussed how I design assignments to help students understand the purpose, task, and assessment criteria for each major writing assignment.

### Sunshine State Teaching and Learning Conference (February 2018)
In collaboration with fellow instructor Megan Lambert, I presented "Teaching Information & Media Literacy in the Age of 'Fake News.'" This session focused on strategies and resources teachers can use to help students navigate the variety of popular and scholarly sources they encounter.

### Online Learning Journal Consortium (Thesis Research Presentation)
While conducting research for my thesis on online writing classes, I presented early findings at the Online Learning Journal Consortium. This presentation discussed the literature that inspired the project and the methodology behind it.

### South Atlantic Modern Language Association Conference
Along with fellow instructors Matthew Bryan and Deborah Weaver, I presented a project titled "Editing a Pedagogy: Using Experience as an Undergraduate Student Editor to Develop an Identity as a Writer and Teacher." This presentation explored how my experience as an undergraduate editor of UCF’s First-Year Composition journal *Stylus* has influenced my teaching practice.

### Rhetoric Society of America Conference & Sunshine State Teaching and Learning Conference (2016 & 2017)
At both of these conferences, I presented a paper titled "Civic Engagement as Persuasive and Invitational." This paper discusses a pedagogy I developed for a "Rhetoric and Civic Engagement" course at UCF, focusing on alternative rhetorics like feminist theory’s invitational rhetoric and its inclusion alongside classical rhetoric, such as Aristotle's. The paper includes sample assignments that could be adapted to include other rhetorics, allowing students to develop a more comprehensive understanding of rhetoric.
